# Openflourishing.org map visualisation

This project provides an interactive web-based view of the openflourishing.org network. It is built using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and uses [react-sigma](https://sim51.github.io/react-sigma/). It is based on the [sigma.js demo](https://github.com/jacomyal/sigma.js/tree/main/packages/demo).

## Dataset

The dataset is embedded in src/dataset.json.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance, creating a single *.js file that is embedded in the website, together with the styles.css information.
